		<h1>Hello and thank you for visiting my website!</h1>
		<p> I am PhillPanic. Who am I and what kind of name is PhillPanic? I am an amatuer programmer working on growing my skills as a Web/Fullstack developer. The Web is the future after all! I dable in many technologies so I figured why not create a space where I can share all my creations? I will be posting many projects, all of which will be using some type of technology that I find interesting. </p>

		<p>As for the for the odd name..? PhillPanic is a  pseudonym I created to maintain some anonymity. I original came up with the name with a friend during the early days of Halo 3 and COD:MW. YES, I am a gamer! Gaming is actually what got me interested in becoming a developer in the first place. Neat right? </p>

		<p>I know there's not much here right now but stay tuned, I am currently working on several interactive projects that you'll be able to try out soon. Some of them might even be...Yep you guessed it, GAMES! I'll also be working on some community features that way you guys can give me some recommendations and ideas on what I can work on next. </p>

		<p>
		Thank you once again and talk to you all soon!	GLHF! </p>
